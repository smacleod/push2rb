    """Post a set of commits to Review Board.

    Repository hooks can use this function to post a set of pushed commits
    to Review Board. Each commit will become its own review request.
    Additionally, a review request with a diff encompassing all the commits
    will be created; This "squashed" review request will represent the push
    for the provided `identifier`.

    The `identifier` is a unique string which represents a series of pushed
    commit sets. This identifier is used to update review requests with a new
    set of diffs from a new push. Generally this identifier will represent
    some unit of work, such as a bug.

    The `commits` argument takes the following form:

        {
            'squashed': {
                'diff': <squashed-diff-string>,
            },

                    'message': <commit-message>,
